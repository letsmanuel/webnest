title: Moving & Arranging Blocks

Right now you are not able to reposition blocks in the visual editor.

You can delete them via the `x` button on every block, but not reposition them in your custom visual script right now.

### Short answer
*You are not able to reposition them, just delete them in the visual editor!*
