title: Visual Editor Overview
---

## Using the Webnest Visual Editor, customers are able to programm simple javascript for their buttons, to add functionality to their website. 


### How it works:
The visual editor includes a set of easy to understand predefined blocks that can be put into the visual editor editing area. Then inputs *like text, variable names* and more are customizable. 
For more advanced users they can either add the custom javascript block into their block script wich allows them to execute 1 line of custom javascript code, or just blatanly write the whole javascript themselves directly into the buttons.

### The limits:
With the Visual Editor customers are able to create basic scrips like redirects, popups, variables and input validation. However the visual editor does not support advanced scripts like Serversided systems, Forms and more.

### The idea:
The editor is meant for **Basic Scripting and not advanced coding!**
