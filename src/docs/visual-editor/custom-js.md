# Custom JavaScript

You can add custom JavaScript to certain blocks (like buttons) to create interactive experiences.

## How to Use

1. Select a block (e.g., Button).
2. In the properties panel, enter your JavaScript code in the "Custom JavaScript" field.
3. Example:
   ```js
   alert('Button clicked!');
   ```

Custom JavaScript runs in the browser and can affect your site's behavior. Use responsibly and test your code before publishing.
