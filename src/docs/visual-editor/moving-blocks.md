# Moving & Arranging Blocks

You can easily move and arrange blocks in the Visual Editor:

- **Drag & Drop:**  
  Click and drag any block to reposition it on the canvas.

- **Layering:**  
  Arrange blocks above or below others for custom layouts.

- **Snap to Grid:**  
  Blocks align to a grid for precise placement.

Use the handles and guides to help with alignment and spacing. You can also use keyboard shortcuts (if available) for fine-tuning block positions.
